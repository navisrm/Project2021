        ---------------------------
        The DLLs delivered by Anaconda3 are located here:
        D:\Anaconda3\Library\bin

        My workaround:
        I have copied the following files

        libcrypto-1_1-x64.*
        libssl-1_1-x64.*
        from D:\Anaconda3\Library\bin to D:\Anaconda3\DLLs.
